    <td>In this lesson I think I  learnt relatively well, using different resources when I was stuck such as teachers as well as other students. Despite this I didn't even start "Function Imports" although I did finish “PygLatin”. A strategy that was effective was using the hint button as well when I was stuck. In previous lessons I had barely noticed this button as the lessons were relatively easy. However this lesson was harder so having helpful hints to guide me made it easier. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that I couldn’t make it to the next lesson limited me since I felt like I was rushing to complete the first lesson. This made limited me because I wasn’t working to my best. A habit that I need to work on is creating the perfect target to achieve with both can be done and is not metaphorically stunting my educational growth. This means I will have to find the right balance between difficulty and easiness.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time my goal will be to complete one goal and get midway through another. This will help me get better at coding since I will not be rushing to complete my goal, nor will I be limited by the amount of work I have set myself. </td>
