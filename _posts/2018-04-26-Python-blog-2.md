    <td>In this lesson, Mr. Ampah Korsah was not here so we had a substitute teacher (Ms. Sealy). I aimed to complete the lesson "Python Syntax". At the beginning of the lesson I was only on stage 2 of 14. The website taught us a lot about python such as: variables, booleans and integers. This gave me a broader understanding of the program. However, sometimes the programs were quite hard making us redo it multiple times and giving us tips along the way. Each stage was split into seperate parts and when all the parts are completed you can move on.</td>

    <td>Eventually I completed the stage with help from some friends. The last stage (stage 14) was a review of everything we did. After the final stage there was a quiz on our multiple topics which included things from throughout the program. Finally I reached the end and received the two badges.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think I learnt well due to the fact that I managed to complete the stage from stage 2. However I think I was a bit slow since some of my friends finished the second stage on strings. In conclusion I think I could have worked better to start the next exercise.</td>
