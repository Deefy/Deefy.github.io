    <td>In this lesson I studied Strings using the website codacademy.com. I made it to the final stage and completed it. However this was very difficult and I got some help from my classmates. However I succeeded and now I understand how Strings work. In addition to this we had a cover teacher today since our normal teacher was supervising some GCSEs.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I work well?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I believe I did work well since I managed to complete the task set and get the badge despite not getting help from a cover teacher. This allowed me to broaden my view on coding with python since I did not have  a teacher to help me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>How could I improve?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I could improve by concentrating and focusing more on the work because I think I could have completed the next lesson if I had really persevered. Next time I will keep my head down and concentrate more on the work.</td>
