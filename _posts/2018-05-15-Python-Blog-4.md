  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I think I learnt well since I completed my target and more. The lessons, although difficult, were able to be completed without any major problems. However, as the lessons go on, the difficulty level rises. For example the variables become more and more obscure since the levels expect you to retain knowledge from previous lessons. A strategy that was effective was looking back on previous lessons to revise the knowledge.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the fact that my target was too small limited my learning. This target limited my learning because it meant that I was aiming high enough. With a target like the one I had, I wouldn't push myself after I completed it. The habit I need to work on is not setting such a low target for myself. This will allow me to get through the lessons quicker.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will make my target to complete two lessons next time so I can push myself so hopefully I can get as many lessons as I can done before the term finishes. I will improve my learning by getting through the lessons quicker so I can complete as many as I can in a single hour.</td>
