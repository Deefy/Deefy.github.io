  <tr>
    <td>Today I think I learnt well since I completed my target and got onto the next lesson. A strategy that was effective was visualising the images in my mind.  This strategy helped since I am more of a visual learner. To visualise the code in my head I would read the question  and then picture it in my head. I felt that this helped because it bettered my understanding of the question.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I was limited by my classmates asking me questions about my blog. This limited my learning because, although I was helping my classmates, I felt I was falling behind due to these distractions. A habit I need to work one is concentrating only on work-related topics of which blogs aren't one.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change my work ethic so I can  get through the lessons more efficiently. This will improve my learning because when I concentrate more, I get more done thus allowing me to complete lessons at an accelerated speed.</td>
