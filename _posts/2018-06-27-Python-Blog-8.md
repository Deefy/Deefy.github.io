  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson, Mr. Ampah Corsa wasn't here due to exams so Mr. Parker was covering. However, despite Mr. Ampah Corsa not being here, I managed to exceed my target. This meant that I think that I learnt well in this lesson. A strategy that was effective was finding the right balance between talking and working. This helped to create a good working atmosphere that was neither too relaxed or too serious.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I worked well, however my inability to carry on after two lessons limited me.  A habit that I need to work on is persevering even after I have finished. This is a habit that I need to work on because although i have finished, there is always more to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will either make a more challenging target or persevere after I have finished my target. I will improve my learning by completing more exercises. </td>
