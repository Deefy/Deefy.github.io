    <td>Last week Mr. Ampah Korsah set us the gargantuan task of completing 25-30% in two weeks. This of course would be challenging and time-consuming so I was determined to finish as much work as I could before the lesson ended. This meant that I would have to strive. In the end I only completed one lesson due to its hardness. I think I learnt well due to the fact that it was a really long lesson. This only meant that I had more to do for my homework. Today I did all of the work in one day spread across around three hours.  A strategy that was effective was completing it all in one go so I didn't have to spend the rest of my life doing the huge amount of work. Instead I only spent a day! This helped not only in this subject since I now also have time to do other work.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think the fact that my teacher said to do over 20% limited me. This is because once that number is in my head I am reluctant to do more (over 30%). A habit that I need to work on is doing that one bit extra that your teacher asked you to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not be bound by what my teacher commands but be open to change and always try to do more. I will improve my learning by both listening to my teacher and taking into account what he says and going above and beyond expectations to further my education in this interesting and insightful project.</td>
