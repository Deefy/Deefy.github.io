  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I thought I learnt effectively since not only did I complete "Functions", I also completed “Taking a Vacation”. A strategy that I thought was effective was reading thought the question and examples slowly and multiple times. This helped to better my understanding of both the question and how to do it. Although this method makes you read slower, in the long term it is much quicker since you almost always know what to do. This is the reason I was able to complete so much in this lesson.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I capped my work at two lessons. This is bad because even though I completed two lessons, there is always more work to do and I should have moved on. A habit that I need to work on is getting myself into the mindset that I can never do enough work and that more learning means more progress. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time, when I complete multiple lessons, I won't stop. This will improve my learning by making me complete more work in the allocated time. This will also give me the ability to create longer blogs for a better reading experience.</td>
