    <td>Today was our first IT lesson of the Summer term. So we had to create a new blog for our new topic: Python. Our teacher, Mr Ampah Korsah, showed us a couple of blogs that looked impressive and explained that we were to destroy our old repository and create a new one. This didn't mean anything for me since my blog was already broken but it did give me the opportunity to get better at coding. In conclusion, I think this project will give me a fresh start enabling me to get a lot better at coding.

    <td>Today Mr. Ampah Korsah informed us on our new topic: Python. This coding system was used to make lots of famous or big websites such as Youtube. We are using a website called codeacademy.com to learn how to code. As we progress we earn medals and these are to be posted on this blog.</td>
